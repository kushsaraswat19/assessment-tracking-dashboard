Step 1: Set Up the Frontend (Next.js)
Create a Next.js Project: Use npx create-next-app to create a new project. This will set up the necessary structure with React, which is optimized for SSR (Server-Side Rendering).
Create Pages: Design pages like index.js for displaying the dashboard, addCandidate.js for adding new candidates, and components like a table to display candidate data.
Styling: Use ShadCN or any design library of your choice for reusable UI components (buttons, tables, modals). Ensure the design is mobile-responsive.
Step 2: Set Up the Backend (Node.js & Express)
Install Dependencies: Use Express for routing, and PostgreSQL or MySQL as the database. Install libraries like dotenv for environment variables, and pg (PostgreSQL client) or mysql2 (MySQL client).
Create Endpoints: Set up RESTful API endpoints like /candidates, /addCandidate, and /updateStatus to handle database operations.
Database Setup: Install PostgreSQL or MySQL and create a database schema with tables to store candidate data (name, assessment status, date, etc.).
Step 3: Connect Frontend to Backend
API Calls: Use axios or fetch in the frontend to call the backend APIs (e.g., fetching candidate data, updating statuses).
Form Validation: Implement form validation on the frontend to ensure correct data input.
Step 4: Deployment
Frontend Deployment: Deploy your frontend to Vercel for easy serverless deployment.
Backend Deployment: Deploy the backend to platforms like Heroku or DigitalOcean.
CI/CD: Set up automated testing, deployment, and version control using GitHub.
This approach modularizes both frontend and backend, ensuring efficiency and scalability.
